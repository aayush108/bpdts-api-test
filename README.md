This is a test project for BPDTS API. This is created as a maven project with JDK 11.

I've created a sample tests for each end point. Although there can be many tests written, I've only included the essential ones for keeping the time under 2 hours.

To run the tests, right click on the BpdtsApiTest class and select run BpdtsApiTest
